## Problem Statement:

Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in
order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data
warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and
particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

## Approach:

 The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. & Trying out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

## Dataset:

Dataset Link: - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data

We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output
variable(s). We need to predict the sales for test data set.

Item_Identifier: Unique product ID

Item_Weight: Weight of product

Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low fat or not

Item_Visibility: The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the
particular product

Item_Type: The category to which the product belongs

Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product

Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID!

Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which store was established

Outlet_Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered

Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city in which the store is located

Outlet_Type: Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
